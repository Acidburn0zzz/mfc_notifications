o Add a distinct marker between "preamble" and the copy of the original
  commit message. This should make parsing of the notification message by
  automatic scripts (such as cvsmerge) easier. Requested by Garance A Drosihn
  <drosih@rpi.edu>.

o Provide better granularity for sending notifications. Currently granularity
  is 1 day, so that if the person did a commit a hour before "time X" when
  the handler is sheduled to run, and specified "MFC after: 1 day" then he
  will receive notification after a hour instead of after 1 day. Requested by
  Luigi Rizzo <luigi@FreeBSD.org>.
  NOTE: I'm (sobomax) not really sure that this feature is worth the trouble.

o Ensure that the notifications are being sent in the same order as the
  commits, i.e. if the person does several sequental commits to the same
  file and specifies exactly the same "MFC after" interval he should receive
  notifications in the right order (FIFO). Seemingly current behaviour is
  opposite - LIFO. Reported by Rober Watson <rwarson@FreeBSD.org>.

o Provide better granularity for sending notifications. Currently granularity
  is 1 day, so that if the person did a commit a hour before "time X" when
  the handler is sheduled to run, and specified "MFC after: 1 day" then he
  will receive notification after a hour instead of after 1 day. Requested by
  Luigi Rizzo <luigi@FreeBSD.org>.
  NOTE: I'm (sobomax) not really sure that this feature is worth the trouble.
